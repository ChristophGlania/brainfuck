	<h1>Brainfuck Run/Debug Support</h1>
	<p>
	Brainfuck files can be started from the Run or the context menu "Run as -> Brainfuck Program".
	Debugging can be initiated the same way.
	</p>
	<h2>Run/Debug Configuration</h2>
	<p>
	Run or debug configurations can be created or edited manually. The following tabs allow
	customizing the configuration.
	</p>
	<h3>Main Tab</h3>
	<img alt="Debug configuration main tab" src="./images/debug/debugConfigMain.png">
	<ul>
	<li><b>Project</b>: Specifies the the project location of a Brainfuck file to run or debug.</li>
	<li><b>File</b>: Specifies the Brainfuck file.</li>
	<li><b>Input File</b>: The Brainfuck Interpreter can be fed data either from the console
	or through a file. A file can be specified here.</li>
	<li><b>Output File</b>: The Brainfuck Interpreters output can be sent to the console or into a file.
	The file can be specified here. Brainfuck can write only bytes to output. To enable the console to write 
	characters outside the 7-bit range correctly, bytes must not be flushed immediately. The debugger is able
	to flush bytes only after a linebreak to accomplish correct encoding (see also Common Tab). As this might lead
	to characters not showing up immediately after they are written while debugging, one can specify for debug mode to write
	out any bytes immediately by checking the "Auto Flush" check box. This setting is ignored in Run mode.  
	</ul>
	<h3>Common Tab</h3>
	<img alt="Debug configuration common tab" src="./images/debug/debugConfigCommon.png">
	<p>
	The settings presented are common to most debug/run configurations. Particularly important for Brainfuck
	are the encoding settings as they determine how input and output are displayed, read or written. Use the
	marked settings if you are reading or writing with encodings differing from the platform settings.
	</p> 
	<h2>Breakpoints</h2>
	The Brainfuck interpreter supports two types of breakpoints, namely breakpoints at specific instructions and
	watchpoints (memory breakpoints). 
	<h3>Instruction Pointer Breakpoints</h3>
	<img alt="Breakpoints in Breakpoint View" src="./images/debug/breakpointView.png"  class="floatImage">
	<p>
	As Brainfuck is not line oriented breakpoints are being set at specific instructions. The exact location
	is in many places depicted with <code>ip=&lt;location&gt;</code> (<code>ip</code> 
	standing for <b><i>i</i></b>nstruction <b><i>p</i></b>ointer).
	</p>
	<img alt="Breakpoint visualization in code" src="./images/debug/breakpoint.png" class="floatImage">
	<p>
	As well Brainfuck breakpoints come with an own annotation type. Its default shows the exact location of a breakpoint
	as vertical line. The visualization can be changed under
	<a href='javascript:liveAction(
	"org.birenheide.bf", 
	"org.birenheide.bf.ui.ActiveHelpOpenPreferencePageAction",
	"org.eclipse.ui.editors.preferencePages.Annotations")'> 
	"Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;General-&gt;Editors-&gt;Text Editors-&gt;Annotations"</a> without affecting the
	visualization of other workbench breakpoints. The debugger will halt <i>before</i> the instruction at the
	instruction pointer is executed, analogous to line breakpoints in other languages. Breakpoints which are active 
	in a running debugging session are marked with a check annotation to indicate that the interpreter has recognized
	this breakpoint. This makes it easy to tell active breakpoints from inactive ones in the breakpoint view.
	After the debugger has stopped, execution can either be resumed or one can step through the code.
	</p>
	<h3 class="nofloat">Watchpoints</h3>
	<img alt="Watchpoint in Breakpoint View" src="./images/debug/watchpoint01.png" class="floatImage">
	<p>
	Watchpoints halt the application when the memory state of a specified memory cell is changed. Beside memory
	location one can specify different conditions for halting.  
	</p>
	<ul class="nofloat">
	<li>Suspend on access: This is synonym for when the memory pointer is set to the specified memory cell.
	The interpreter is stopped in this case. It will stop again only if the memory pointer is moved away from 
	the cell and then moved to the cell location again.</li>
	<li>Suspend value: any. In this case the interpreter stops on every change at the specified memory location.</li>
	<li>Suspend value: a specified value. In this case the interpreter stops when the value at the specified memory
	location is changed to the value specified. It is permissible to define multiple watchpoints for the same
	memory location with different values specified.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	Access and modification properties can be changed from the watchpoints context menu in the Breakpoints View.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Displaying Debugging Information</h2>
	The two most prominent informations one needs are the <b><i>i</i></b>nstruction <b><i>p</i></b>ointer (ip)
	and the <b><i>m</i></b>emory <b><i>p</i></b>ointer (mp) location.<br>
	The instruction pointer value is shown in decimal to ease finding the location in the source code (a text hover
	in the source code shows locations as well). The memory pointer and its values are displayed in hexadecimal.
	All values in hexadecimal are preceded by <code>0x..</code> followed be the value.
	<h3>Debug View</h3>
	<img alt="Debug View" src="./images/debug/debugView01.png" class="floatImage">
	<p>
	The debug view shows comprehensive information when the interpreter halts. The debug target and process
	show the file name and optionally some additional information (when code has been replaced).
	The single stack trace (Brainfuck does not support method calls, obviously) shows information about the actual
	<b><i>i</i></b>nstruction <b><i>p</i></b>ointer in decimal (to ease locating the place in the source code) and
	the actual <b><i>m</i></b>emory <b><i>p</i></b>ointer location in hexadecimal.
	</p>

	<h3 class="nofloat">Memory View</h3>
	<img alt="Memory View" src="./images/debug/memoryView01.png">
	<p>
	The memory contents of the Brainfuck application is shown in the memory view. The view should come up
	automatically when the debugger halts. Otherwise it can be opened under 
	<a href='javascript:liveAction(
	"org.birenheide.bf", 
	"org.birenheide.bf.ui.ActivHelpOpenViewAction",
	"org.eclipse.debug.ui.MemoryView")'> 
	"Window->Show View->Other->Debug->Memory".</a>
	The actual location of the memory pointer is highlighted with light gray background. As the interpreter
	comes with dynamically growing memory space a new rendering is created whenever the size of the memory
	is increased.	 	
	</p>
	<p>
	The memory view is the Eclipse standard memory view which comes with the debug infrastructure. Therefore one
	can visualize the memory locations using:
	</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Other memory renderings such as the default ASCII rendering. Only the Brainfuck Memory rendering will show
	the location of the memory pointer, however.</li>
	<li>Customized memory ranges. The default will show always the entire addressable range. When allocating
	large amounts of memory this may be not desirable.</li>
	</ul>
	<img alt="Memory View Settings" src="./images/debug/memoryView02.png" class="floatImage">
	<p>
	The default visualization can be hard to parse therefore the settings depicted here are recommended
	which correspond to a final picture as shown above. Once the memory view contains an active session when
	the debugger stops it can be set from the context menu under "Format...".
	</p>
	<h3 class="nofloat">Instruction Pointer</h3>
	<img alt="Instruction Pointer" src="./images/debug/instructionpointer01.png" class="floatImage">
	<p>
	The instruction pointer is displayed in the code with an own annotation whichs appearance can be set in
	<a href='javascript:liveAction(
	"org.birenheide.bf", 
	"org.birenheide.bf.ui.ActiveHelpOpenPreferencePageAction",
	"org.eclipse.ui.editors.preferencePages.Annotations")'> 
	"Window-&gt;Preferences-&gt;General-&gt;Editors-&gt;Text Editors-&gt;Annotations"</a> 
	as well. The default displays the instruction at which the execution halts with a blue background. 
	The highlighted instruction is the one which will be executed next. Hovering the annotation will 
	display more detailed information.
	</p>
	
	<h3 class="nofloat">Hot Code Replacement</h3>
	When the file underlying an active debug session is changed, the code is (optionally) replaced with the new
	code. The location of the instruction pointer or the memory pointer remain unchanged. Keep in mind that this
	property may lead to different behavior of the program when freshly started.
	Hot Code Replacement can be switched off in the 
	<a name="DebugPreferences" href='javascript:liveAction(
	"org.birenheide.bf", 
	"org.birenheide.bf.ui.ActiveHelpOpenPreferencePageAction",
	"org.birenheide.bf.Debug")'>Debug Preferences</a>.<br>
	In each of the cases the Debug Target in the Debug View is marked appropriately.
